# WHAT ARE THESE FILES

<p>All of the files with a language in the name of the file are considered JSON translation files.<br>
JSON translation files contain all of the WickedWhims text strings.</p>

# HOW TO TRANSLATE

1. Choose the JSON translation file that corresponds with the language you want to translate for and download it.
2. Open the downloaded JSON translation file with any text editor and translate each line that beings with the "Value" variable.
3. If you're done with translating the JSON file, proceed to the [Translation Tool page](https://github.com/TURBODRIVER/WickedWhims/tree/master/String%20Tables/Translation%20Tool).

<p>To find if a "Value" line still needs translating, look for {entries} that include "Status" as "Unchanged".<br>
You can adjust/correct any line with "Value" regardless of any "Status" if you want to. The "Original" line contains the original English text string as reference.<br>
Do not change the "Key", "Source", or "Original" line.</p>

# HOW TO SUBMIT TRANSLATIONS

<p>If you're looking to contribute your translation efforts, you have a few ways to do it.<br>
First you should follow the <b>HOW TO TRANSLATE</b> section. Once you made changes to the JSON file, you need to submit it.<br>
Depending on your technical knowledge:</p>

 - If you don't have a GitHub account you can send an email to <code>wickedwoohoo@gmail.com</code> with your JSON translation file attached and information about what you've done and your name to be included as an author.
 - [Submit an issue](https://github.com/TURBODRIVER/WickedWhims/issues) with the JSON translation file attached and information about what you've done.
 - [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/TURBODRIVER/WickedWhims/pulls) if you know what you're doing.
