# WHAT ARE THESE FILES

All of the files with a language in the name of the file are considered JSON translation files.
JSON translation files contain all of the WickedWhims text strings.

# HOW TO TRANSLATE

1. Choose the JSON translation file that corresponds with the language you want to translate for and download it.
2. Open the downloaded JSON translation file with any text editor and translate each line that beings with the "Value" variable.
3. If you're done with translating the JSON file, proceed to https://github.com/TURBODRIVER/WickedWhims/tree/master/String%20Tables/Translation%20Tool

To find if a "Value" line still needs translating, look for {entries} that include "Status" as "Unchanged".
You can adjust/correct any line with "Value" regardless of any "Status" if you want to. The "Original" line contains the original English text string as reference.
Do not change the "Key", "Source", or "Original" line.
